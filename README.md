# Machine Learning Development Homework

Objective:
The objective of this homework is to practice the end-to-end machine learning
development process, including data exploration, model building, and result summary.

Problem : Classification
Your task is to predict whether the customer is going to default the loan or not.
You can study about the dataset using this kaggle link [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset/data)
You may see how others worked on this dataset but I encourage you to make your own code to practice on data analysis and machine learning development.
